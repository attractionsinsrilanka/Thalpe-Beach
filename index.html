		Nestled away from the hustle and bustle of the major towns in the southern coastal belt, Thalpe is a quiet town, known for its mesmerising unspoilt beaches. A short drive from Galle, this popular tourist destination has it all – history, adventure, culture and cuisine.

		Dip your toes in the cool water as you stroll along the stunning beach or stop by a café on Talpe Beach and enjoy succulent seafood cuisine. Along this part of the coast, stilt fishermen are a common sight – ideal for those who want to learn more about the way of life in this charming town. Watch as the fishermen perch precariously on stilts firmly embedded in the sand, as they expertly cast their lines above the waves.

		For travellers on the lookout for interesting Galle Tours, Thalpe remains as a must-visit. Among the sights to see, the Galle Fort is perhaps the most popular attraction. Built in the 17th century, it is one of the largest remaining fortresses in Asia and is listed as a World Heritage Site. Be sure to visit other popular attractions such as the Martin Wickramasinghe Folk Art Museum, the stunning Koggala Lake and the Dutch Reformed Church when you travel to Thalpe, Galle.
